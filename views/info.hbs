        <p>Power Tools is an NRLHS EAST project that aims to create a website focused on helping students with managing their projects. The project started when I noticed how none of the EAST projects I had worked on had been planned out well, even though I was told many of the things to plan out. I figured that if I created some form of platform that gives you the exact things you need to ask, answer, plan, etc. it would help make all sorts of projects go a lot smoother. Currently, a (semi) functioning website has been created that has authentication, a dashboard, project creation, project calendars, project tasks, project members, and more. When someone creates an account on the website, they are greeted by a dashboard page where they can create new projects or join projects they've been invited to. If they choose to create a new project they're asked a few basic questions that makes them think a little about the goal of their project. Once finished with this, they are brought to a page where they can view and modify all of the project's information, invite new members, plan new tasks, and edit a calendar specifically for their project. Hopefully this project will be able to help many students with their school projects, EAST projects, and more.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The websiteâ€™s server is created with the NodeJS runtime (allows for using JavaScript outside of a web browser) with the Express module. Authentication is handled by the Passport.js module. The website client is created using Handlebars, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project currently is using a free-tier MongoDB database. All of the source code (beside access keys) is publicly available at https://github.com/sqwyer/power-tools.</p>
